     <h1>    MY FRIENDS CALL ME NESS   </h1>
     <h2>   I'm a single parent father of two</h2>
     
     <p><strong>I was born in bay area .east bay:</strong>.
     I come from a large family nine girls three boys i am second 
     to the youngest i have one younger sister .</p>
     
     <p>I was raised mostly by my mother my parents separated when i was verry young it was for them the right thing to do i lived with four sisters my and my mother till i was about thirteen then moved in with my father i liked the bay area much more than fresno you can make a better living wage and back then it was what i thought was most important i have worked at quite a few diffrent companys it was good for me the company i was working with closed the plant i was working in moved it back east without much notice it was hard on many of us some lost thier homes we were making plant food</p>

     <p> I dont think the way i did back then it was the best thing that could have happend i was one of the people who lost thier home i came back to fresno becouse my mother was sick and my step father had just had open heart surgery i was lucky becouse my mother got better and came home from the hospital i was able to be there for her and my step father i found work i was able to make and save in three years the money to buy the place next to my mom i was able to spend the last seven years of my moms life seeing her every day  and so was my son he was able to feel the love i felt when i was growing up i believe i am the luckiest man on the planet becouse of the mother i had we very close and she was and still to this day the strongest person i've ever known she is missed very much but will never be forgotton </p>

     <p>It's not were you live but how you live it's not what you have it's what you do be grateful for the day it is the best gift you will ever get no mater how much wealth  we achieve the most valuable is simply.</p>
